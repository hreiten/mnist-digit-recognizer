# mnist-digit-recognizer

The aim of this repository is to compare the performance of several different learning algorithms tasked with classifying a set of handwritten digits and determine if they are even or odd. The training and testing sets used are found in the _data_-folder.

The following machine learning methods are implemented and compared: 
* __Tree-based Methods__
    * Classification Trees
    * Random Forest
    * Bagging
    * Boosting
* __Nearest Neighbors__
    * K Nearest Neighbors
* __Support Vector Machines__
* __Neural Networks__
    * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
